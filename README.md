### What I learned

##### Working with Back End, when user: 
 * logins to this page, 
 * registers to this page, 
 * logs out
 
 * add/ remove items to cart
 * see payment in totals
 * check out

##### Reflection
* Working with Front End, I practice CSS skills with flex box, grid to style the website the same with Figma design.
